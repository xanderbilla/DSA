# Experiment 5 | Process management using System Calls

## Class Exercise

- [**Class Exercise 1**: Create an orphan process using fork system call. Demonstrate that the child process is adopted by init process.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%205/Class_Practice01%20-%20Orphan.c)
- [**Class Exercise 2**: Create a zombie process using fork system call. Demonstrate that the parent process is alive and the child process is a zombie.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%205/Class_Practice02%20-%20Zombie.c)

## Exercise

- [**Exercise 1**: Program to illustrate perform n consecutive fork() system calls generate 2^n child processesprompt user to enter the value of n and display the process id of each child process.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%205/Practice%2001%20-%20sysCallfork.c)
- [**Exercise 2**: Program to utilize the fork() system call to gnerate the following process hierarchy: 
P1 -> P2 -> P3 the program should display the process id of each process and the parent process id of each process.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%205/Practice%2002%20-%20sysCallfork_2.c)
- [**Exercise 3**: Program to generate a process hierarchy as follows:](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%205/Practice%2003%20-%20sysCallfork_hierarchy.c)

                             P1
                            /  \
                          P2    P3
                        /
                       P4
                       /
                     P5
