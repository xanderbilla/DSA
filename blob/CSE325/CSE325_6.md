# Experiment 6 |  Creation of Multithreaded Processes using Pthread Library

## Class Exercise

- [**Class Exercise 1**: write a program to create a thread using pthread_create() and pthread_join() functions. The thread should print a message "Thread created successfully" and the main thread should print "Thread terminated".](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Class_Practice%2001%20-%20libCallThread.c)
- [**Class Exercise 2**: write a program to create a thread using pthread_create() and pthread_join() functions. The thread should print a message "Thread created successfully" and the main thread should print "Thread terminated".](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Class_Practice%2002%20-%20libCallThreadCreate_join.c)
- [**Class Exercise 3**: Write a program that creates a thread and returns a value from the thread to the main program. The main program should print the value received from the thread. The thread should receive a number as an argument and return the square of the number.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Class_Practice%2003%20-%20libCallThreadReturnValue.c)
- [**Class Exercise 4**: Write a program that creates a thread and passes a message to the thread. The thread should print the message received from the main program.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Class_Practice%2004%20-%20libCallThreadMessage.c)

## Exercise

- [**Exercise 1**: Program using pthread to concatenate multiple strings passes to the thread function](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_01.c)
- [**Exercise 2**: Create a pthread program to find the length of strings passed to the thread function.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_02.c)
- [**Exercise 3**: Implement a program that performs statistical operations (calculating average, maximum, and minimum) for a set of numbers. Utilize three threads, where each thread performs its respective operation.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_03.c)
- [**Exercise 4**: Write a multithreaded program where a globally passed array of integers is divided into two smaller lists and given as input to two threads. Each thread sorts their half of the list and then passes the sorted lists to a third thread, which merges and sorts them. The final sorted list is printed by the parent thread.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_04.c)
- [**Exercise 5**:  Create a program using pthread create to generate multiple threads. Each thread should display its unique ID and execution sequence](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_05.c)
- [**Exercise 6**: Create a threaded application that demonstrates graceful thread termination using pthread exit for resource cleanup compared to abrupt termination via pthread cancel.](https://github.com/xanderbilla/LPU-Academics/blob/main/CSE%20325%20-%20OS%20LAB/Experiment%206/Practice_06.c)
